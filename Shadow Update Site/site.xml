      <description>
         This plug-in provides syntax highlighting, brace matching, and code folding support for Shadow source files in the Eclipse IDE.  If a Shadow compiler is available in the form of a shadow.jar file, the plug-in can also outline code, report errors and warnings in the source code, and compile and launch programs.
